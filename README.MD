## Idea
The idea is to create your interactive resume as a blog. In it I will be able to write a story about how I study new technologies, and other users will also be able to comment on my posts in the future.
## Analysis of the task and review of analogs
### 1) High-Level Overview
The project presents a personal blog. Target audience -
people interested in working with me or just me. People will be able to find out
what skills I have and how they can be useful.
### 2) High-level description of parts
The first final version will have the role of an admin and a regular user.
Admin will be able to post posts and like them, and users will only be able to 
like posts. In the future, the ability to comment posts will be added.
Posts will be stored in the database, as well as data on registered users.
New post - new entry in the database.
### 3) Description of analogs
As analogs, the first thing that comes to mind when the word "Blog" is the LiveJournal 
resource or google blog, also exist from the popular Yandex Zen. All these sites have
the same meaning, they rather differ only in interfaces, all have one idea - to create
a page and run it like a blog in which other users can leave comments. In my case, there will also be a page, but one on which it will be possible to leave posts in the form of a comment, in the future it is planned to add comments to posts.
### 4) Comparative analysis of analogues
We will evaluate on a five-point scale

Name |Passive income | Communication with the audience | Page customization | The ability to add photos to comments | Support
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- 
LiveJournal | 2 | 5| 3 | 1 | 3
Yandex Zen | 3 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 5 
Blogger (Google Blog) | 5 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 2
### 5) Conclusion
You need to understand that the idea of this blog is that it is for one person, but it 
is also worth comparing with large-scale projects and taking successful experience from
them. You can take a good opportunity for monetization from a Google blog, add the ability
to work with advertising, and from Yandex you can take the ability to add photos to 
comments (comments in the first version will most likely not be implemented), as well 
as the implementation of good technical support so that users can quickly contact me 
and get an answer. You can take a convenient interaction with the audience from the
live magazine, but in this case it will not be difficult to implement here anyway, 
all posts will be seen ideally as a list, comments will be on them.
